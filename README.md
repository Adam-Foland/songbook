This is a set of:
 - songs (in XML format)
 - tools to generate PDFs, EPUBs and HTMLs out of this songs
 - web editors to enable easy edits of the songs.

# Songs

Currently the songs are hosted in the [./songs] directory.
They are mostly Polish scouting and turists songs. If the set growths, we will organize it into language specific directories.

# Editing of the songs

# Generating of PDF songbooks

Running the render script requires:
1) a python environment with dependencies listed in requirements.txt
2) a pdflatex compiler with ucs, extsizes, and Polish localization support

# Generating of EPUBs songbooks
